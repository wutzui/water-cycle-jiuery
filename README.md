# Water Cycle

This is a website demo talks about the water cycle. 

The earth has a limited amount of water. That water keeps going around and around and around and around... in what we call the "Water Cycle".

This cycle is made up of a few main parts:

- evaporation (and transpiration)

- condensation
- precipitation

The goal  of making this site is to create a playful interface and user experience for the user while exploring the site. Most of the contents were created in Adobe Illustrator and exported as png files, then imported into the HTML. The interactions are created with jquery such as draggable items, show and hide buttons, and click triggered events work with CSS animation. 

Users can use click, mouse hover, scroll down to the page and try on the question marks to see what is happening during the cycle.
